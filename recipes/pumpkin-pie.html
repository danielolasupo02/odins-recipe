    <h1> A Collection of Recipes for Chef John's Pumpkin Pie</h1>
    <p> This best pumpkin pie recipe came about after many years of experimentation. I've finally perfected what I think is the ideal formula for a rich pumpkin pie that's much less likely to crack on top. Serve garnished with whipped cream and freshly grated nutmeg</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
        <li> 3 egg yolks</li>
        <li> 1 large egg</li>
        <li> 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg </li>
        <li> ⅛ teaspoon Chinese 5-spice powder</li>
        <li> 1 9-inch unbaked pie crust (see footnote for recipe link) </li>
    </ul>
    <h1> Directions </h1>
    
    <h4> Step 1</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </p>

    <h4> Step 2</h4>
    <p>Whisk together pumpkin, egg yolks, and egg in a large bowl until smooth. Add sweetened condensed milk, cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, and Chinese 5-spice powder; whisk until thoroughly combined. </p>

    <h4> Step 3</h4>
    <p> Line a 9-inch pie plate with pie crust; crimp edges. </p>

    <h4> Step 4</h4>
    <p>Pour filling into crust; lightly tap on the counter to release air bubbles. </p>

    <h4> Step 5</h4>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. </p>

    <h4> Step 6</h4>
    <p> Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until just set in the middle, 30 to 40 more minutes. A paring knife inserted into the filling, 1 inch from the edge, should come out clean. Allow to cool completely before serving. </p>
